**The password for Century12 is the name of the hidden file within the contacts, desktop, documents, downloads, favorites, music, or videos folder in the userâ€™s profile.**

Not the best to do it i think, because didn't manage to do it in one commands so i check each directories individualy. I think there's a better way to do it.

- make `ls` on one of the directory and add the parameter `-force` to show the hidden file
