**The password for Century5 is the name of the file within a directory on the desktop that has spaces in its name.** 

- First make a `ls -directory` to see the directory on the desktop
- The directory we're looking at as space in it's name there's just one `Can you open me`
- To go on this directory use `cd` and add the name of the directory but because there's space on the name need to put the name between bracket like this `cd "Can you open me"`
- Finaly make a `ls` to see the name of the file
